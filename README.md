After cloning repo to your local machine:

Ensure your files are up to date with github by runnung:

git pull
  
Next create a branch to work on your part:
git checkout -b "any name here"
(Delete quotes when naming your branch)
  
  
Once you have the code open in vscode:
- You will need to install node modules:
npm i
  (You should now have a folde called node_modules)
- To start the server run:
  npm run dev
  (Site will run on port 4000)
  (Type "localhost:4000/" in your browser)
- You can now start adding your parts to the code.
- Every time you save the server will automatically refresh without having to kill it.


You can test your code by using postgre on your local machine
- Look at .env file. That is how i am connecting to my local database.

* I can write commands here to help out.
